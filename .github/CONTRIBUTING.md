# Contributing 

Thank you for considering to contribute to SOX!

We would appreciate any and all contributions, partial or complete, and try to respond to all issues/pull requests as soon as we can! 

Contributing doesn't have to be with code! Fixing a simple typo, or helping us document code/update the wiki, is equally as important! :)

Please see the [Contributing Wiki](https://github.com/soscripted/sox/wiki/Contributing) for full details on how you can help out with SOX.
