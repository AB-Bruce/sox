#Coding Guidelines

## Feature Functions
 - Description should be added on the first line of the function
 - All functions should run within their defined areas, eg. not running unless they need to
 


## Feature CSS
 - CSS rule definitions should start with the name of the function for which they are defined. eg `.functionName-element`
